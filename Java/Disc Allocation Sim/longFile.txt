The disk should store its contents in an array.  The storage will consist of 256 blocks of 512 bytes each.  The first block is for the file allocation table.  The second block is a bitmap for free space management.  The remaining blocks hold data for the files.  The disk object only knows how to read and write blocks by block number (array index).
The file system object is responsible for storing and retrieving files on the disk.  It can use any of the three file allocation methods the user chooses.  Space is allocated using a first available approach, meaning it uses the first free space it finds that satisfies the request.  The file system object may use other objects to implement the different allocation methods.
